            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Recycling involves converting waste materials into reusable materials to reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials and minimize environmental impact. Proper recycling helps in waste reduction, conservation of natural resources, and reducing pollution.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Collection and Sorting</h3>
                <p>The recycling process begins with the collection of recyclable materials from households and businesses. These materials are then sorted at recycling facilities to separate them by type, such as paper, glass, plastic, and metal.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Cleaning and Processing</h3>
                <p>Once sorted, the materials are cleaned to remove contaminants. After cleaning, they are processed into raw materials that can be used in manufacturing new products.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>The processed materials are then used to manufacture new products. For example, recycled paper is used to make new paper products, while recycled plastics are used to create new plastic items.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Distribution and Use</h3>
                <p>The newly manufactured products are distributed and used by consumers, closing the recycling loop and reducing the need for new raw materials.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Recycling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Waste Reduction: Recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, conserving landfill space.</li>
                <li>Resource Conservation: Recycling conserves natural resources by reusing materials instead of extracting new raw materials.</li>
                <li>Energy Savings: Recycling often requires less energy compared to producing new products from raw materials.</li>
                <li>Environmental Protection: Recycling reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste disposal and raw material extraction.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="data">
            <h2>Real-World Data</h2>
            <p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2022, the United States recycled and composted approximately 35% of the 292.4 million tons of trash generated. This recycling rate helped save about 186 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, equivalent to taking 39 million cars off the road for a year.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation revealed that recycling could reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste by up to 80% compared to using new plastic materials.</p>
