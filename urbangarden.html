                <h3>Container Gardening</h3>

            <article>
                <h3>Vertical Gardening</h3>
                <p>Vertical gardening maximizes space by growing plants upwards using trellises, shelves, and wall-mounted planters. This technique is perfect for urban settings with limited ground space.</p>
